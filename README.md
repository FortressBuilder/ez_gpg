# ez_gpg
Personal take on what a GPG UI should look like

Still missing:
- Multi-file handling
- DnD
- Key management
- <del>PyPI packaging that works</del>
- Debian packaging
- PPA

## Prerequisites

python3-gnupg (`sudo apt-get install python3-gnupg`, PyPI /`pip` gnupg package does not work since it's an API-incompatible fork), Gtk 3.0.

## Installation

- Clone
- Install prerequisites

## Running

- Run `./ezgpg` from the checkout directory
